Linux
-----

Install a flavor of Ubuntu (Xubuntu is recommended). 

Familiarize yourself with the operating system and the terminal. The terminal will be your main way of interacting with the os. Have a look at [1] for a quick overview.

Use the cheat sheets at [2] to refresh your memory.

Use the terminal to install software that will be used later:
```
> sudo apt-get install tree cmake doxygen git
```

We will use Sublime Text as a text editor. Download the program from [3], navigate to the `Downloads` directory and execute:
```
> sudo dpkg -i sublime-text*amd64.deb
```
