Projects
--------

Each project has a `README.md` file that introduces the project and acts as a guide while working with it.

All necessary actions will be performed through the terminal. Each time, the default current working directory is assumed to be the this `examples` directory.

Open the `examples` directory with SublimeText to have access to all projects:
```
> # cd software-development-by-example/examples
> subl .
```

Use often the `tree` command to observe the project structure and the produced files. With the `-L <num>` option, you can limit the maximum depth of the displayed directory tree.

Below is an overview of all the projects.
