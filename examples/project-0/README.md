project-0
---------

**Intro**

Single source file program.

**Guide**

We will use the `g++` compiler to compile our program.

```
> cd project-0
> g++ code.cpp -o program
```

The above command specifies that we want to compile the `code.cpp` source file and create an executable (output) with the name `program`.

Now, execute the compiled program.

```
> ./program
```
