project-7
---------

**Intro**

Link multiple CMake projects.

**Guide**

In this project, we are going to create two CMake projects. `project-7-lib` will build and install the libraries, and `project-7-bin` will build the executable and link against the installed libraries.

Read the `README.md` files in the above packages for more details.
